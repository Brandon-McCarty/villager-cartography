# PROJECT NAME

Villager Cartography

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

While playing the game Minecraft, there is no easy way to store the coordinates and information of locations and interesting sites you stumble across. This application is meant to help organize and keep any of that information in one central location. This application allows the user to create their own world or join another user's world. A user can join a world by obtaining the join code from the creating user, which is randomly generated upon world creation. Within any of their worlds, the user can add, update, or delete locations of interest discovered while playing the game. Users are able to name a location, store the coordinates, mark as explored, and add any addtional comments.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `villager_cartography',
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres for Intel, M1 is postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgres` in your terminal
to start the database
5. Run `npm run server` in your terminal to start the server.
6. Run `npm run client` in your terminal to open the client.
